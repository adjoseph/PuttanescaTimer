Pomodoro Timer To-Do:
- add functionality to create fully custom programs, ie: let the user customize the order that different periods automatically switch to when time is up
- end to end test suite


Bugs:
- time initially displays with only one 0 in the minutes place
  - Bug fixed, but in a haphazard way: if seconds == 0, it displays as the string "00"
